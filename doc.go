// Package blackfriday is a markdown processor.
//
// It translates plain text with simple formatting rules into an AST, which can
// then be further processed to HTML (provided by Blackfriday itself) or other
// formats (provided by the community).
//
// The simplest way to invoke Blackfriday is to call one of Markdown*
// functions. It will take a text input and produce a text output in HTML (or
// other format).
//
// A slightly more sophisticated way to use Blackfriday is to call Parse, which
// returns a syntax tree for the input document. You can use that to write your
// own renderer or, for example, to leverage Blackfriday's parsing for content
// extraction from markdown documents.
//
// If you're interested in calling Blackfriday from command line, see
// https://github.com/russross/blackfriday-tool.
