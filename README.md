# ....

... is a fork of blackfriday is a [Markdown][1] processor implemented in
[Go][2]. It supports a number of extensions, inspired by Leanpub, kramdown and
Asciidoc, that allows for large documents to be written. It is specifically
designed to write internet drafts for the IETF.

It is paranoid about its input (so you can safely feed it user-supplied data),
it is fast, it supports the following extensions

* tables
* definition lists
* smart punctuation
* substitutions
* [TOML][4] titleblock
* including other markdown files
* indices
* main-, middle- and backmatter divisions
* citations
* abstract
* asides
* IAL, inline attribute list

And it is safe for all utf-8.
HTML output is currently supported, along with Smartypants
extensions. An XML2RFV v3 output engine is also included.
Adding DocBook output should not be that hard.

It started as a translation from C of [upskirt][3].

## Usage

For basic usage, it is as simple as getting your input into a byte
slice and calling:

    output := blackfriday.MarkdownBasic(input)

This renders it with no extensions enabled. To get a more useful
feature set, use this instead:

    output := blackfriday.MarkdownCommon(input)

### Custom options

If you want to customize the set of options, first get a renderer
(currently either the HTML or LaTeX output engines), then use it to
call the more general `Markdown` function. For examples, see the
implementations of `MarkdownBasic` and `MarkdownCommon` in
`markdown.go`.

You can also check out `blackfriday-tool` for a more complete example
of how to use it. Download and install it using:

    go get github.com/russross/blackfriday-tool

This is a simple command-line tool that allows you to process a
markdown file using a standalone program.  You can also browse the
source directly on github if you are just looking for some example
code:

* <http://github.com/russross/blackfriday-tool>

Note that if you have not already done so, installing
`blackfriday-tool` will be sufficient to download and install
blackfriday in addition to the tool itself. The tool binary will be
installed in `$GOPATH/bin`.  This is a statically-linked binary that
can be copied to wherever you need it without worrying about
dependencies and library versions.


Features
--------

All features of upskirt are supported, including:

*   **Compatibility**. The Markdown v1.0.3 test suite passes with
    the `--tidy` option.  Without `--tidy`, the differences are
    mostly in whitespace and entity escaping, where blackfriday is
    more consistent and cleaner.

*   **Common extensions**, including table support, fenced code
    blocks, autolinks, strikethroughs, non-strict emphasis, etc.

*   **Safety**. Blackfriday is paranoid when parsing, making it safe
    to feed untrusted user input without fear of bad things
    happening. The test suite stress tests this and there are no
    known inputs that make it crash.  If you find one, please let me
    know and send me the input that does it.

    NOTE: "safety" in this context means *runtime safety only*. In order to
    protect yourself agains JavaScript injection in untrusted content, see
    [this example](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday#sanitize-untrusted-content).

*   **Fast processing**. It is fast enough to render on-demand in
    most web applications without having to cache the output.

*   **Thread safety**. You can run multiple parsers in different
    goroutines without ill effect. There is no dependence on global
    shared state.

*   **Minimal dependencies**. Blackfriday only depends on standard
    library packages in Go. The source code is pretty
    self-contained, so it is easy to add to any project, including
    Google App Engine projects. And TOML!

*   **Standards compliant**. Output successfully validates using the
    W3C validation tool for HTML 4.01 and XHTML 1.0 Transitional.


Extensions
----------

In addition to the standard markdown syntax, this package
implements the following extensions:

*   **Intra-word emphasis supression**. The `_` character is
    commonly used inside words when discussing code, so having
    markdown interpret it as an emphasis command is usually the
    wrong thing. Blackfriday lets you treat all emphasis markers as
    normal characters when they occur inside a word.

*   **Tables**. Tables can be created by drawing them in the input
    using a simple syntax:

    ```
    Name    | Age
    --------|------
    Bob     | 27
    Alice   | 23
    ```

*   **Fenced code blocks**. In addition to the normal 4-space
    indentation to mark code blocks, you can explicitly mark them
    and supply a language (to make syntax highlighting simple). Just
    mark it like this:

        ``` go
        func getTrue() bool {
            return true
        }
        ```

    You can use 3 or more backticks to mark the beginning of the
    block, and the same number to mark the end of the block.

*   **Autolinking**. Blackfriday can find URLs that have not been
    explicitly marked as links and turn them into links.

*   **Strikethrough**. Use two tildes (`~~`) to mark text that
    should be crossed out.

*   **Hard line breaks**. With this extension enabled (it is off by
    default in the `MarkdownBasic` and `MarkdownCommon` convenience
    functions), newlines in the input translate into line breaks in
    the output.

*   **Smart quotes**. Smartypants-style punctuation substitution is
    supported, turning normal double- and single-quote marks into
    curly quotes, etc.

*   **LaTeX-style dash parsing** is an additional option, where `--`
    is translated into `&ndash;`, and `---` is translated into
    `&mdash;`. This differs from most smartypants processors, which
    turn a single hyphen into an ndash and a double hyphen into an
    mdash.

*   **Smart fractions**, where anything that looks like a fraction
    is translated into suitable HTML (instead of just a few special
    cases like most smartypant processors). For example, `4/5`
    becomes `<sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>`, which renders as
    <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub>.

*   **Includes**, support including files with `{{filename}}` syntax.

*   **Indices**, using `(((item, subitem)))` syntax.

*   **Citations**, using the citation syntax from pandoc `[@RFC2535 p. 23]`, the citation
    can either be informative (default) or normative, this can be indicated by using
    the `i` or `n` modifer: `[@RFC2535(n)]`.

    To make the references work you can optionally include a filename:
    `[@RFC233(n:bib/reference.RFC.2525.xml)]`. If you reference an RFC or ID
    the filename will be contructed automatically.

*  **Asides**, any paragraph with `A>` at the beginning of all lines is an aside.

*  **Notes**, any parapgraph with `N>`

*  **Abstracts**, any paragraph with `AB>`

*  **{frontmatter}/{mainmatter}/{backmatter}** Create useful divisions in your document.

*  **IAL**, kramdown's Inline Attribute List syntax, but took the commonMark
    proposal, thus without the colon `{#id .class key=value key="value"}`.

*  **Definitition lists**, the markdown extra syntax, short syntax is not supported (yet).

*  **TOML TitleBlock**, add an extended title block prefixed with % in TOML.

Todo
----

*   More unit testing
*   Markdown pretty-printer output engine
*   Improve unicode support. It does not understand all unicode
    rules (about what constitutes a letter, a punctuation symbol,
    etc.), so it may fail to detect word boundaries correctly in
    some instances. It is safe on all utf-8 input.
*   Fix `<section>` output
*   Ordered list start number detection
*   Correctly close document when there is no TOML titleblock
*   Auto anchors for sections
*   pretty print XML
*   <<{{CODE}} code include from leanpub?
*   alignment in tables
